# Turing Machine Simulation

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE.md)

## Description
This project is a Turing Machine simulation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as the final project assignment for the TBA (Theory of Computation) class of 2023, A class, Team 3. The purpose of this project is to showcase the implementation of a Turing Machine, which is a theoretical computing device that manipulates symbols on a tape according to a set of rules. Through this simulation, users can gain a deeper understanding of the functioning and behavior of Turing Machines. The web-based interface allows users to input custom Turing Machine programs, visualize the tape, step through the execution, and observe the transitions between states. By exploring different configurations and programs, users can observe the computational power and versatility of Turing Machines. This project aims to provide an interactive and educational tool for studying the foundations of computation and automata theory.

## Installation
This project actually doesn't need web server but for security reason it is not possible due to Cross-origin resource sharing mechanism. So, web server is needed. Open index.html using live-server, xampp, apache, or any web server. Alternatively you can use any CORS unblock extension to open index.html directly using web browser.
